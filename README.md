Establishes and configures data pipeline from database to end user dashboard

## Please note that code has been redacted and will not compile on your system without adjusting source file names, packages, and/or database specs

You will need to set up a Streamlit account and connect to your Github account. A requirements.txt file is needed to load dependencies: pandas, pandasql, plotly

Authentication tokens should always be stored in a seperate file, not hardcoded

Files should be run as follows:
  1. pull_data
  2. push_commit
  3. report_sl
